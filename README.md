# Weather Theme App

This is a Flutter app that allows users to view weather information and customize the app's theme (light and dark modes).

## Features

* **Theme Switching:** Users can easily switch between light and dark themes to match their preferences.
* **Location Input:**  Users can search for weather information in any city.
* **Weather Card:** A visually appealing card displays current weather details (temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed).
* **API Integration:**  The app fetches weather data from a reliable weather API.
* **Shared Preferences:**  User preferences (like the selected theme) are saved using `SharedPreferences` for persistence across app sessions.
